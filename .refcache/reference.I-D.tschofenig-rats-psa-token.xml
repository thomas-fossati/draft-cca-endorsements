      <abstract>
	 <t>   The Arm Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware
   and firmware security specifications, as well as open-source
   reference implementations, to help device makers and chip
   manufacturers build best-practice security into products.  Devices
   that are PSA compliant can produce attestation tokens as described in
   this memo, which are the basis for many different protocols,
   including secure provisioning and network access control.  This
   document specifies the PSA attestation token structure and semantics.

   The PSA attestation token is a profile of the Entity Attestation
   Token (EAT).  This specification describes what claims are used in an
   attestation token generated by PSA compliant systems, how these
   claims get serialized to the wire, and how they are cryptographically
   protected.

   This informational document is published as an independent submission
   to improve interoperability with Arm&#x27;s architecture.  It is not a
   standard nor a product of the IETF.
